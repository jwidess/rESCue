/**** Calibration / Calculation of VOLTAGE_DIVIDER_CONSTANT ****

To measure voltages between 0V and ~100V we need a voltage divider. I use
a voltage divider of a 470k and a 22k resistor.
The 470k is connected between the battery plus and the ESP32 GPIO (e.g. 36)
The 22k is connected between the battery plus and battery minus.
Since the ESP32 Pin also has an resistance, we have to measure and calculate the constant.

Take a power supply and connect it to the voltage divider. Set the voltage to a constant value 
in the upper range of your maximal battery voltage, e.g 50V. Than measure the voltage at the 
outside of the voltage divider. 
You now have to divide the constant voltage with the measured value, e.g

50.4V / 1.822V =  27.69

Do the same at the lower edge of your battery voltage, e.g. 40V

40V / 1.445V = 27.68

Now you have two values for the typical range of your battery. In this example it's 
a value of 27.69 as VOLTAGE_DIVIDER_CONSTANT is pretty ok.

You always have to do the calibration when changing the resistors or the ESP32.
